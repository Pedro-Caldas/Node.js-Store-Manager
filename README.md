# Store-Manager (Node.js)

## Description
In the Store Manager project, we were asked to develop a **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API to manage a store's data regarding its products and sales. With this objective in mind, we structured this **RESTful API** according to the **MSC** (Models, Services and Controllers) architecture, linking it to the store's database with greater security and stability.

This project has several management routes made with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle one or more **MySQL** tables at the same time. In addition, we have high coverage of tests done with **Mocha**, **Chai** and **Sinon** to ensure code quality and functionality.

## Main used technologies:
Node.js

Express.js

MySQL

Mocha, Chai and Sinon

## Instructions to utilize the application
After cloning the repository, you need to install the necessary dependencies with the `npm install` command and start the project with the `node index.js` command. After that, you can make requests using an **HTTP client** (Insomnia, Postman, HTTPie, etc.).
